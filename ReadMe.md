# VP8

VP8 will be a virtual computer that you can code in 6502 assembly

Current TODO list:
- Finish the instruction_functions.rs
- Find a way to have a some sort of GUI for the output (128x128)

Future goals:
- Refactor, a lot of it
- Debug functionality
- Hexdump functionalitt
- Optimizations if possible and as long as it doesn't hurt the code readability
